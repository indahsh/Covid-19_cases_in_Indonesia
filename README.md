I completed this project while participating in Fresh Graduate Academy at [Digital Talent Scholarship](https://www.linkedin.com/in/indahsh/details/education/968984033/multiple-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAADQ0K_IBB-BflJ1wnBkU3Z47qF6xVW9xyvI&treasuryMediaId=1714306461924). The dataset used is COVID-19 case in Indonesia, spanning from March 1, 2020, to September 15, 2022, and was obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hendratno/covid19-indonesia?resource=download).
